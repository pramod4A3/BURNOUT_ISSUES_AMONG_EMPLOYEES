# Employee Burnout Analysis

-> This repository contains the code and data for the employee burnout analysis project. The project aims to analyze a dataset of 22,750 employees to identify factors that contribute to burnout.

-> The dataset contains information about the employees' employee ID, date of joining, gender, company type, WFH setup available, designation, resource allocation, mental fatigue score, and burn rate.

-> The code in this repository can be used to load the dataset, explore it, and perform statistical analysis. The results of the analysis can be used to identify factors that contribute to burnout and to develop interventions to reduce 
   burnout.

# Getting Started
-> To get started, you will need to install the following Python libraries:

  pandas
  numpy
  matplotlib
  seaborn
-> Once you have installed the libraries, you can load the dataset and explore it using the code in the explore_data.py file.

-> To perform statistical analysis, you can use the code in the analyze_data.py file

# Project Goals
* The goals of the employee burnout analysis project are to:

> Identify factors that contribute to burnout.
> Develop interventions to reduce burnout.
> Increase awareness of burnout and its impact on employees.
> Project Methodology
> The project will use a data-driven approach to identify factors that contribute to burnout. The dataset will be explored using descriptive statistics and visualization techniques. Statistical analysis will be used to test hypotheses about 
  the relationship between burnout and various factors.

>Computing resources: The project will be hosted on Google Colab.

* The project team will consist of the following members:
  Project lead: Pramod sagar Yenubari
  Project Dissemination
-> The results of the project will be disseminated through the following channels:

-> A technical report will be published on the project website.
-> A presentation will be given at a conference.
-> The results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal.
